Mr. Kyriakopoulos manages stress effectively and can maintain a high performance under heavy pressure. Furthermore, he has a positive personality with a “can-do” attitude and works hard to efficiently accomplish his targets.
Concluding my letter, based on my experience, which I hope I have depicted well in the previous paragraphs, I would like to unreservedly recommend Mrs. Fotini Valeonti for your post-graduate program.

He is a technology enthusiast with a strong desire to learn new products/programming languages/software and hardware techniques and drill into their details. These competencies have been demonstrated through his project which required some of the latest Microsoft or other party technologies to be used. His technical level in programming and use of technology is by far more advanced from what is expected from an undergraduate student.
I believe that Mr. Sakkos will successfully deliver on the high expectations of your institution. Should you request further information please do not hesitate to contact me at v-digkan@microsoft.com, or +306949200458.
I have known Mr. Sakkos for 3 years, as he joined the Microsoft Student Partners team I lead at Microsoft. The team consists of top students from Greek universities who have a duty to organize communities to discuss academic and related issues. Panagiotis leads a successful community in the University of Athens with more than 300 registered members, organizes technical events, workshops, “hackathons” and presents about advanced topics in software development and engineering. I also really like the fact that he has developed numerous successful projects using not only Microsoft technologies but most of the cutting edge platforms out there.
Regarding Mr. Sakkos' technical skills, he is one of the most sophisticated problem solvers I have ever collaborated with. Given his wide range of knowledge of computer science and engineering topics, he effectively overcomes the challenges that come up during a task/project. Plus, his code writing skills are great, as he insists on solving each and every problem he encounters using maintainable and easy to read code.
